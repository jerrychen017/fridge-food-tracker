<h2>HOW TO START OUR APPLICATION</h2>

1) Start the server manually
- We haven't yet deployed a server yet, so you have to start it locally

  >   cd server
  >
  >   node index.js</code>
   

2) Open the app
- Open our project in Android Studio
- Run our MainActivity on an emulator
  - We are using a Pixel 3a API 29


<h2>ITERATION 2</h2>

We've implemented manual data entry as our first feature.
